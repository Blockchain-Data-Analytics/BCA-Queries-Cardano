> for a limited time during the beta-phase of this project we provide a **50% reduction** on the subscription fee

You can subscribe to this service in our

**&#128722; [Shop: Cardano Queries](https://shop.bca.sbclab.net/products/cardano-queries)**

for a monthly fee.

There are two options: either connect to our infrastructure in USA, or in Europe. Depending on your location this can reduce latency and thus increase query performance. 

After your payment, we will prepare your access credentials and send them to your email address.

We cannot provide you with a strict SLA. But, we promise to keep the services alive and fix technical problems asap. We have decent monitoring in place and will be able to react to service disruption.

See our [main page](https://github.com/Blockchain-Data-Analytics) for contact details.
